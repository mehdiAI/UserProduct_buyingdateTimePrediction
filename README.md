EDA and Predicting when a customer will buy a particular product. <br />
By purchasing transactions and their dates for each product customer and extracting the required features, as well as building an ML model, a time prediction model was built. <br />
It should be mentioned that in the second stage, the extraction of features was supposed to be done by another method called window, but due to the lack of time and because it was an educational project, it was not possible to continue the project, that's why this amount was enough. <br />
